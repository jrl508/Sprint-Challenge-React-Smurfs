1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server-side-routing is "the old way" of routing between resources in an app, the client would click a link and serve up a request, the server than will fetch that data and render a whole new template containing the requested data but not before refreshing the page. Client-side-routing manipulates the state in order to remove the need to refresh entirely. This is done through the Component-Based architecture used in React.
